# Project: Hack-and-Slash Overview

Our project is a game called Witchfire, which has the player try to survive as long as possible versus many enemies.
Witchfire implements a score system through how many enemies they have destroyed using dynamic and intuitive combat.
We have also implemented two different types of enemies, sound effects and game soundtrack, and a lot of art and animations.

# Controls

W or Up Arrow for Up

A or Left Arrow for Left

D or Right Arrow for Right

S or Down Arrow for Down

Left Mouse Button to Shoot Fireballs

-- IMPORTANT --
Occasionally Unity may have problems when pulling code causing weird line breaks due to Unity's structure.

These lines can include <<<<<HEAD and -------, along with a few others.

You may need to delete these lines yourself.

Also, the code may duplicate from old code as well. Please check or ask on our Slack for more information.
